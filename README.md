# SITT-MAT

### Privacy

Maintaining patient and participant privacy is of primary importance for this project. For this reason, the `data` and `raw_data` folders have already been added to `.gitignore` so they will not be uploaded to Github. You will need to download the data from the source using your credentials and run the analyses to be able to see the data.
